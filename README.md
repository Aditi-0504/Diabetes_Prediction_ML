# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using the
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features: 8 medical attributes
- Target: Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## Model Used
- Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)
- StandardScaler for feature scaling

## Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Feature scaling
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Single input prediction

## Accuracy
